# Install 

Enable the `Tracing` extension, by adding the service provider to your `config/app.php`, as described on oficial Lighthouse GraphQL documentation. Note this is not a feature from this package.

```php
'providers' => [
    \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Tracing\TracingServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Require the package.

```
composer require robsontenorio/lighthouse-dashboard
```


Publish package assets.

```
php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:publish
```

Configure the package.

```php
// config/lighthouse-dashboard.php

return [
    /**
     * Authenticated user attribute for identify the current client.
     * 
     * If there is no authenticated user a `anonymous_client` will be used.
     * Default is `Auth::user()->username`
     */

    'client_identifier' => 'username',

    /**
     * Database connection name for the dashboard.
     * 
     * By default it uses different connection. You must create it.
     * Or set it to `null` if want to use same connection from target app.
     */

    'connection' => 'dashboard',
];
```

Run package migrations.

```
php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:migrate
```

Open the dashboard.

```
http://your-app/lighthouse-dashboard
```

To keep the assets up-to-date and avoid issues in future updates, we highly recommend adding the command to the post-autoload-dump section in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [
            ...
            "@php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:publish"
        ]
    }
}
```

# How does it works?

<details>
<summary>See more ...<br><br></summary>

By enabling `Tracing` extension on Laravel Lighthouse GraphQL Server, every operation automatically is profiled with its execution metrics.

- GraphQL request is made.
- Dashboard listen to `ManipulateResult` event and collect metrics from current operation.
- Metrics are stored on dashboard.

The GraphQL server performance is not affected by this package, once metrics are collect after response is sent by server.

By default, metrics are stored on same target app database. But if you want to keep things separated you can select a different database connection to store metrics.

/config/lighthouse-dashboard.php
```php
return [
    /**
     * Authenticated user attribute for identify the current client.
     * 
     * If there is no authenticated user a `anonymous_client` will be used.
     * Default is `Auth::user()->username`
     */

    'client_identifier' => 'username',

    /**
     * Database connection name for the dashboard.
     * 
     * By default it uses different connection. You must create it.
     * Or set it to `null` if want to use same connection from target app.
     */

    'connection' => 'dashboard',
];
```

Once this package includes UI, the only way to test it is by running it through target app.

### Uninstall  

If you previous installed this package, first uninstall it **from target app**.

Remove this entry from `composer.json`.

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [
            ...
            "@php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:publish"
        ]
    }
}
```

Remove installed package assets folder.

```
rm -rf /path/to/app/public/vendor/lighthouse-dashboard
```

Remove package.

        }
    }
```
