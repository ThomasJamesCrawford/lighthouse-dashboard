# Install 

Require the package.

```
composer require robsontenorio/lighthouse-dashboard
```


Publish package assets.

```
php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:publish
```

Configure the package.

```php
// config/lighthouse-dashboard.php

return [
    /**
     * Authenticated user attribute for identify the current client.
     * 
     * If there is no authenticated user a `anonymous` will be used.
     * Default is `Auth::user()->username`
     */

    'client_identifier' => 'username',

    /**
     * Database connection name for the dashboard.
     * 
     * By default it uses different connection. You must create it.
     * Or set it to `null` if want to use same connection from target app.
     */

    'connection' => 'dashboard',
];
```

Run package migrations.

```
php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:migrate
```

Open the dashboard.

```
http://your-app/lighthouse-dashboard
```

To keep the assets up-to-date and avoid issues in future updates, we highly recommend adding the command to the post-autoload-dump section in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{    
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [            
            "@php artisan lighthouse-dashboard:publish"
        ]
    }
}
```

# How does it works?

<details>
<summary>See more ...<br><br></summary>

By enabling `Tracing` extension on Laravel Lighthouse GraphQL Server, every operation automatically is profiled with its execution metrics.

- GraphQL request is made.
- Dashboard listen to `ManipulateResult` event and collect metrics from current operation.
- Metrics are stored on dashboard.

The GraphQL server performance is not affected by this package, once metrics are collect after response is sent by server.

     * Default is `Auth::user()->username`
     */

    'client_identifier' => 'username',

    /**
     * Database connection name for the dashboard.
     * 
     * By default it uses different connection. You must create it.
     * Or set it to `null` if want to use same connection from target app.
     */

    'connection' => 'dashboard',

     /**
     * Silent tracing.
     * 
     * This package auto-register TracingServiceProvider from "nuwave/lighthouse".     
     * This is a required feature to make this package working.     
     * 
     * But if you do not want including tracing output on server response just set it to `true`.
     * 
     */
    'silent_tracing' => false
